//! Age-encrypted secrets for lusid plans.
//!
//! A lusid project stores secrets as individual `*.age` files under a
//! `secrets/` directory. At apply time the host's age/SSH identity decrypts
//! the subset of files it's a recipient for and hands the plaintexts to
//! `@core/secret` resources by name. Plaintexts never enter the Rimu
//! evaluator — plans reference secrets by name, contents materialise at
//! apply.
//!
//! ## Public surface
//!
//! - [`Secrets`] / [`Secret`] — the decrypted bundle handed to the rest of
//!   the apply pipeline, plus the per-entry plaintext wrapper.
//! - [`Secrets::load`] — one-shot load from `(secrets_dir, identity_path,
//!   guest_mode)` into a ready-to-use bundle, returning [`LoadError`].
//! - [`Redactor`] — substring-scrubs known secret plaintexts out of
//!   per-operation stdout/stderr.
//! - [`reencrypt_for_machine`] — host-side re-encrypt of every `*.age` under
//!   a directory for a single target's public key; used by `dev apply` /
//!   `remote apply` to ship per-target ciphertext bundles.
//! - [`cli`] — the `lusid secrets ...` subcommands.
//!
//! Lower-level primitives (identity parsing, `lusid-secrets.toml` loading,
//! per-file encrypt/decrypt, alias matching) are kept crate-private. They're
//! the building blocks for the public surface above; reopen them if a third
//! consumption pattern needs direct access.
