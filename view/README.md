# lusid-view

Serializable styled-text view primitives for the lusid streaming UI.

Types in lusid's domain (resource params, resources, states, changes,
operations) implement [`Render`](src/render.rs) to produce a [`View`]. Views
travel as JSON over `lusid-apply`'s stdout pipe and are re-hydrated in the
TUI, where `termtree`'s `Display` draws them as indented trees.

## View shapes

```text
View
├── Span       — styled text run (one segment)
├── Line       — Vec<Span> + optional style / alignment
├── Paragraph  — Vec<Line>  + optional style / alignment
└── Fragment   — Vec<View>  (concatenation, no separator)
```

Plus [`ViewTree`]: `Branch { view, children } | Leaf { view }` — a recursive
wrapper with a `Display` impl that delegates to
[`termtree`](https://docs.rs/termtree).

[`TextStyle`] carries `{fg,bg}_color`, bold/italic/underlined/crossed_out,
and underline colour. [`Color`] is the 16 standard terminal colours.

## Adding Render for your type

For types that already `Display` cleanly:

```rust
lusid_view::impl_display_render!(MyType);
```

For anything richer, implement [`Render`] by hand and return the appropriate
`View` variant.

## Note

The current TUI (`lusid/src/tui.rs`) uses `ratatui` for styling and only
reads the text content of views (via `Display`). [`TextStyle`] et al. are
reserved for a future renderer that honours them, or for non-TUI consumers.
