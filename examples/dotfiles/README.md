# lusid dotfiles example

A minimal dotfiles-style setup demonstrating `state: "linked"` for
`@core/file` and `@core/directory`.

## What it does

Run `lusid local apply` and the plan creates two symlinks under `$HOME`:

- `~/.zshrc` → `examples/dotfiles/files/zshrc`
- `~/.config/helix/` → `examples/dotfiles/files/helix/`

Edits to the source files in this repo show up immediately at the symlink
targets — no re-apply needed.

## `sourced` vs `linked`

`@core/file` and `@core/directory` both offer two ways to materialise a
host-path source on the target:

| State | What it does | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `state: "sourced"` | Copies the bytes (file) or recursively copies the tree (directory) into `path`. Accepts `mode`/`user`/`group`. | The bytes need to live independently on the target — e.g. system configs, deployable artifacts, or anything you'd run via `dev apply`/`remote apply` where the operator's filesystem isn't reachable from the target. |
| `state: "linked"` | Materialises `path` as a symlink to `source`. No `mode`/`user`/`group`. | You're editing config files in place and want changes to take effect without re-running apply — the dotfiles ergonomic this example uses. |

Both forms validate at plan-load time that `source` exists and has the
expected type (regular file for `@core/file`, directory for `@core/directory`).

## Running

```sh
lusid --config examples/dotfiles/lusid.toml local apply
```

Override `home` in `lusid.toml` (or pass `--params '{"home": "/home/<you>"}'`)
so the symlinks land somewhere you actually own.
